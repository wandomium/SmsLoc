SmsLoc is an application that queries the location of contacts without the use of mobile network. It uses GPS to retrieve current position and SMS for requests/responses.

SMS request format: `Loc?`
SMS response format: `Loc:LAT,LON,ASL,UTC_S,V_KMH,ACC_M,BAT_PCNT`, where:
 - `LAT, LON` are latitude and longitude in degrees rounded up to 4 decimal places.[^1]
 - `ASL` or Above Sea Level is the absolute altitude as reported by the GPS in meters
 - `UTC_S` is the timestamp of the GPS fix in seconds. The timestamp corresponds to the time of the actual fix, and not when SMS was received.
 - `V_KMH` is the speed in kilometers/hour
 - `ACC_M` is the accuracy reported by the GPS chip in meters
 - `BAT_PCNT` is the battery percentage of the device sending the response
